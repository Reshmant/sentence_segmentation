      "Home automation or domotics is building automation for a home, called a smart home or smart house\n",

      "\n",
      "It involves the control and automation of lighting, heating (such as smart thermostats), ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), and security, as well as home appliances such as washer/dryers, ovens or refrigerators/freezers\n",

      "Home devices, when remotely monitored and controlled via the Internet, are an important constituent of the Internet of Things\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern systems generally consist of switches and sensors connected to a central hub sometimes called a \"gateway\" from which the system is controlled with a user interface that is interacted either with a wall-mounted terminal, mobile phone software, tablet computer or a web interface, often but not always via Internet cloud services.While there are many competing vendors, there are very few worldwide accepted industry standards and the smart home space is heavily fragmented\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Popular communications protocol for products include X, Ethernet, RS-, LoWPAN, Bluetooth LE (BLE), ZigBee and Z-Wave, or other proprietary protocols all of which are incompatible with each other\n",

      "Manufacturers often prevent independent implementations by withholding documentation and by litigation.The home automation market was worth US$\n",

      "It is a communication protocol for electronic devices\n",

      "By , X products included a  channel command console, a lamp module, and an appliance module\n",

      "() there are three generations of home automation:The word \"domotics\" (and \"domotica\" when used as a verb) is a contraction of the Latin word for a home (domus) and the word robotics.In a review of home automation devices, Consumer Reports found two main concerns for consumers:Microsoft Research found in , that home automation could involve high cost of ownership, inflexibility of interconnected devices, and poor manageability.Historically systems have been sold as complete systems where the consumer relies on one vendor for the entire system including the hardware, the communications protocol, the central hub, and the user interface\n",

      "\n",
      "All have an API.Acronym explanation:Home automation suffers from platform fragmentation and lack of technical standards a situation where the variety of home automation devices, in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them, makes the task of developing applications that work consistently between different inconsistent technology ecosystems hard\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Customers may be hesitant to bet their IoT future on proprietary software or hardware devices that use proprietary protocols that may fade or become difficult to customize and interconnect.The nature of home automation devices can also be a problem for security, since patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-price devices\n",
